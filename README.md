# Full Stack Web Application with Next.js and NoSQL Database

## **Project Overview**
This project is a full-stack web application built with **Next.js** for the frontend and backend, integrated with a NoSQL database for dynamic and unstructured data management. The application demonstrates CRUD operations, responsive design, and seamless backend integration.

## **Technologies**

### **Frontend**
- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)  
  - Provides server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG).  
  - Simplifies routing with file-based routing.  
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS or CSS Modules (Optional).  

### **Backend**
- **Framework**: Node.js with Next.js API Routes.  
  - Serves as the backend for handling business logic and API endpoints.

### **Database**
- **NoSQL Database**:  
  - [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) for scalable document-oriented storage.  
  - [Firebase Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore) (Optional alternative) for real-time data handling.  

### **Tools**
- **MongoDB Compass**: For database visualization and query testing.  
- **Firebase Console**: If Firebase is used as the backend database.

## **Key Features**
1. **Frontend**:
   - User-friendly interface with dynamic routing and responsive design.
   - Pages rendered using SSR or SSG for improved performance and SEO.
   
2. **Backend**:

   - Middleware for authentication and validation.

3. **Database**:
   - Schema-less design for flexibility.
   - Real-time data updates (if Firebase is used).

4. **Core Functionalities**:
   - Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on dynamic data.
   - Example: User management, product catalog, or blog platform.
