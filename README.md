# DBMS_PROJECT
what we are intended to do?

SQL-Based RDBMS Implementation
Lab Experiments Overview:
SQL Commands:
Create a demo program to demonstrate commonly used SQL commands.
DDL: CREATE DATABASE, DROP DATABASE.
DML: CREATE TABLE, INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE, SELECT.
Joins: Inner Join, Left Join, Right Join, Full Join.
RDBMS Prototype Development:
Core Functionalities:
Design a schema using CREATE TABLE statements.
Insert, delete, update, and query data using SQL commands.
Front-End and Back-End Connectivity:
Choose a programming language/framework for the front end (e.g., Python Flask/Django, Java Swing, HTML+JS).
Connect it to the database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) using drivers like mysql-connector, SQLAlchemy, or JDBC.
Sample Work Plan:
Week 1: Design the schema and implement basic SQL queries.
Week 2: Develop a simple front end to interact with the database.
